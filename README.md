# Data-Wrangling

This project demonstrates the process of loading, wrangling, cleaning, and visualizing a dataset. We will be using a dataset named `tmdb-movies.csv` which contains information about movies. The project is divided into the following steps:

1. Loading the Data: Importing the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
2. Data Wrangling: Inspecting, selecting relevant features, and transforming the data.
3. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and correcting data types.
4. Data Visualization: Creating visualizations to uncover insights from the data.
